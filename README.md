# KNN_PPT

The presentation explains the working principle of KNN, which involves calculating distances between data points and selecting the K nearest neighbors. It discusses the considerations for choosing the value of K and highlights different distance metrics, such as Euclidean and Manhattan distances.

The pros and cons of KNN are outlined, emphasizing its simplicity, non-parametric nature, and ability to handle various tasks, while also acknowledging computational complexity and sensitivity to feature scaling. Real-world applications of KNN, including image classification, recommender systems, and fraud detection, are mentioned to showcase its practical utility.

In conclusion, KNN is a versatile algorithm that can be applied to classification and regression tasks. Its implementation involves selecting neighbors based on distance metrics, and the choice of K and distance metric significantly impact model performance. KNN's advantages and limitations make it a valuable tool in machine learning, finding applications across diverse domains.
